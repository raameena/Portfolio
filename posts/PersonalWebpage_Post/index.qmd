> In Summer 2025 I decided to challenge site-building AIs and build my own website. Although users these days primarily rely on tools such as WordPress to create their websites, I wanted to get in on some of the fun and try making it myself (with the help of YouTube, ChatGPT, and Gemini). Below is the stack, the lessons, and what else is in store.

## ♡ Why roll my own site?

::: {.content-card}

* Showcase **front-end skills** (not just content).  
  Hiring managers can view the source and see real code, not Wix widgets.

* End-to-end control over performance, accessibility & design.  
  I choose the fonts, colours, and load-time budget.

* <mark>Quarto</mark>’s Markdown → <mark>HTML</mark> pipeline lets me write posts in plain text,  
  **render once** and host anywhere (GitHub Pages today, Netlify tomorrow).
