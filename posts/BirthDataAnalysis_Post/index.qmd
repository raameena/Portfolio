> **How maternal education shapes fertility patterns and infant health across the United States (2016 – 2021).**  
>
> We stitched together **6 years of provisional NCHS records** (≈ 20 M births), cleaned 1.2 GB of raw CSVs into a single tidy table, and fed it through a fully reproducible <mark>R</mark> × <mark>tidyverse</mark> workflow. The result is an interactive report that quantifies regional disparities, isolates key predictors, and pin-points policy levers for healthier outcomes.

## ♡ Research questions

::: {.content-card}

1. **Education → birth outcomes**  
   How does maternal schooling predict birth weight and maternal age across
   states and years?

2. **Education → family size**  
   Are mothers with lower formal education more likely to have multiple
   children than highly-educated mothers?

## ♡ Headline findings

::: {.content-card}

* **Education inversely tracks fertility.**  
  High-school-only and *some college* mothers account for most births, while
  PhD / MD holders delay childbirth and have fewer children overall.

* **Higher education ⇒ healthier babies.**  
  Each jump in schooling adds ≈ **85 g** to mean birth weight (*p* < 0.001).

* **Age amplifies the effect.**  
  In the interaction model, every extra year of maternal age adds **+41 g**
  for PhD mothers but only **+1 g** for high-school drop-outs.

* **Regional split.**  
  New England & the West host the most college-educated, older mothers; the
  Deep South clusters at younger ages & lower schooling.

## ♡ Policy take-aways

::: {.content-card}

* **Education is a lever.**  
  Keeping women in school correlates with later, healthier births.

* **Target by geography.**  
  Southern states stand to gain most from prenatal-care subsidies and
  health-literacy programmes.

* **Next steps.**  
  Add paternal education and local healthcare spend to explain the remaining
  variance.
