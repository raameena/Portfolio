   - <mark>query_classifier.py</mark>: Classifies user queries for appropriate handling
   - <mark>query_translator.py</mark>: Translates queries for better AI processing
   - <mark>algebra_solver.py</mark>: Dedicated module for algebraic problem-solving
   - <mark>general_handler.py</mark>: Manages general query processing
   - <mark>history_handler.py</mark>: Tracks user interaction history
   - <mark>wolfram_api_solver.py</mark>: Integration with Wolfram Alpha for computational solutions

### ðŸš§ In Progress

3. **Frontend User Interface (SWE):** Currently developing React components for an intuitive user experience with real-time AI interactions.

4. **Enhanced Algebra Solver (SWE):** Expand <mark>algebra_solver.py</mark> with additional algorithms for complex mathematical operations, equation solving, and symbolic computation.

5. **User Interaction Dashboard (SWE/DS):** Create a user-facing dashboard that visualizes personal usage statistics, query history, and learning progress using data processed by Pandas and visualized with Plotly.

6. **Usage Analytics & Insight Engine (DS):** Build an admin-facing analytics module to analyze aggregated, anonymized user data to understand learning patterns and query characteristics.

7. **Predictive Quality Monitoring (DS):** Implement user feedback mechanisms and satisfaction prediction using Scikit-learn classification models.

8. **Database Integration (SWE):** Implement PostgreSQL database for persistent storage of user queries, interaction history, and analytics data.
