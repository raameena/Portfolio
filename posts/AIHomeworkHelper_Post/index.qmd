However, I am taking two classes ( Calc 3 and Ethics ) and want to make a specialized AI **myself** that will make these classes ( and future classes ) less work.

## ♡ Updates

### June 18, 2025

I will shortly begin working on an AI Homework Helper, I plan to integrate SWE and DS with this project. I will need to learn a lot abut how AIs function and behave along with back end logistics ( I've never worked with back end so bear with me ). I want to integrate ds by gathering input data and presenting them to the user ( their individual stats of some sort ) using pandas and numpy. This is still early ideas, I my change them with time.

## ♡ AI Functions

::: {.content-card}

* Be able to find quotes in pdfs that the user uploads
* Give the exact line, sentence number, or paragraph of said quote
* Record frequency of topics the user asks questions on + display report
* Record lengths of user's inputs and accuracy of AI's response ( ask user if answer was accurate ) -> does longer input = more accurate response ?
* Use the data to tweak the AI to be more accurate
